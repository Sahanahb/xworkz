1. Syntax Error

2. Error

3. Error

4. Length = 4, sum = 200.

6. Method parameters are variables or values that are passed into a method when it's called. 
   They define the data that the method operates on. 
   Parameters are specified within parentheses following the method name and are separated by commas. 
   
7. Compile time polymorphism is achieved through method overloading and method overriding. 
    Example:  
				class Calculator {
					int add(int a, int b) {
						return a + b;
					}

					double add(double a, double b) {
						return a + b;
					}

					public static void main(String[] args){
						Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
						int cal1 = calculator.add(2, 3);         
						double cal2 = calculator.add(2.5, 3.5); 
					}
				}		

8. It allows method to accept a variable number of arguments of the same type.
   It simplifies method calls when the number of arguments is not known in advance.
   
9. A package is used to organize related classes, interfaces, and sub-packages into a hierarchical structure.
	Single Type Import
	Static Import
			
10. Constructor chaining : where one constructor calls another constructor within the same class or its superclass.
	class Person {
		String name;
		int age;
		String address;

        Person(String name) {
			this.name = name;
		}


		Person(String name, int age) {
			this(name); 
			this.age = age;
			this.address = address;
		}


		Person(String name, int age, String address) {
			this(name, age); 
			this.address = address;
		}
}

11. class FibonacciRecursion {

		public static int fibonacci(int n) {
			if (n <= 1) {
				return n;
			} else {
				return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
			}
		}

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10; 
        System.out.println("Fibonacci sequence up to " + n + " numbers:");
		for (int num = 0; num < n; num++) {
            System.out.print(fibonacci(num) + " ");
        }
    }
}

14. An enum is a user-defined data type in programming languages that represents a set of named constants. 
	It is a way to define a group of related symbolic values that are treated as discrete types. 
	Enum are particularly useful when you have a fixed set of possible values that are related to each other and have specific meanings.
	
15. The JVM allocates memory for the object on the heap.
	The new expression returns a reference to the object. 
	
16. Instance Variables
	Member Functions
	Constructors
	Interfaces
	Enums
	Static Methods
