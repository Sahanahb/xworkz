Java Test

1. java is a programming language is used for developing software applications. 
   javac is a java compailer it consist of JDK,JVM and JRE it converts the java code into a bitecode.
   
2. JDK(Java Development Kit) is a software package that includes tools for developing, compiling, and running Java applications.
   JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a subset of JDK that provides the necessary runtime environment to execute Java applications.
   jVM(java virtual machine) is a compailee wher it runs the program.
   
3. Declaration of array
   DataType[] arryName = new DataType();
   String[] name = new String();
   
4. Class is a blue print / design of an object whic contains variables and function.
   Object is a real world entity.
   Syntax of class :class FileName {
					}
   
5. Array is a collection of homogenies element.

6. java file is a program file where it is not directly understood by the computer.
   class file is a bitcode of the java file it generate after the compailetion of the java file.
   
7. The length of the array is 6.

8. Main method :
		public static void main (String[] args) {
		}
	where public - access specifer
		  Static - non access specifer
		  void	 - return type
		  main	 - method name 
		  (String[] args) - parameters
		  
   method with return type :
		static datatypeOfReturnValue methodName() {
		
		}

9. java is a high level, general purpouse programming language developed by sun Microsystem it is platform independence, 
   reilable and secure. java nees to have a type,it is the most widely used programminglanguage.
   
10. variable stores the address of the value in the momory location and it is alsa called as reference.
    There are two type of variables :
    Local variable : A local variable is a variable declared within a specific scope, such as a function or block, 
	and can only be accessed within that scope.

    Global variable : A global variable is a variable declared outside any specific scope, making it accessible throughout 
	the entire program. 
	
11. A class variable is a variable that is shared among all instances of a class. 
   It is defined within the class scope but outside any specific method.
   
12. Data type is a classification that determines the type of values that can be stored 
   in a variable or used in an expression within a programming language.
   
   There are two types of data types
   1. primitive data types
   2. Non - primitive data types
   
   Primitive data types are 
   
   Integer: Represents whole numbers without fractional parts, such as 5 or -10.
   Floating-point: Represents numbers with fractional parts, allowing for decimal values, like 3.14 or -2.5.
   Boolean: Represents a logical value that can be either true or false.
   Character: Represents a single character, such as 'A' or '$'.
   Long: Represents whole numbers without fractional parts, we have to include 'L' in ending.
   Double: Represents numbers with fractional parts, allowing for decimal values more than 8 decimal points.
   Short: Represents whole numbers without fractional parts, from -127 to 128.
   Byte: Represents whole numbers without fractional parts.
   
   Non Primitive data types
   
   String: Represents a sequence of characters, such as "Hello world!".
   
16. System.out.println() is statement where it prints the sentences or value that are written inside the paranthices.

13. Object oriented programming
	Platform Independence
	Dynamic
	High Performance
	Autometic memory management
	
14. type of array's are:
   
   Single-Dimensional Array: This is the most common type of array in Java. 
   It stores elements of the same data type in a linear fashion, forming a one-dimensional structure.
    
   Multidimensional Array: Java allows the creation of multidimensional arrays, such as 2D, 3D, or higher-dimensional arrays
   
   Array of Objects: In Java, arrays can also hold objects of a class. 
   
15. An "ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException" is a runtime exception in Java that occurs when trying to access an array element using 
    an index that is outside the valid range for the array.
	
17. In Java, the double equals operator (==) is used for equality comparison between two operands.

18.In Java, the dot operator (.) is used to access members (fields and methods) of a class or object.

19. The java.lang.Object class is the root of the  all class in Java. It serves as the base class for all other classes in Java, directly or indirectly.
